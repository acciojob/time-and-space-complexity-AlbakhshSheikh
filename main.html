    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster and more suitable for large inputs.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. It includes both the auxiliary space and the input storage. For example, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) means that its memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
