    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An
        efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, making it faster for large inputs.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. It is typically
        expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to describe how memory usage scales with input size.</p>
