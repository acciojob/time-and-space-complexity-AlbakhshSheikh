    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity and performs better for large inputs.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. For example, an algorithm with <b>O(n)</b> space complexity requires additional memory proportional to the input size.</p>
